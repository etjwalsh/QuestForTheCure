  description: Graham is the proud owner of a small antique store right in the heart
    of Eugene, Oregon. He inherited it from his grandmother, who loved collecting
    little trinkets and old stuff. The oldest piece in his store is a doll that dates
    all the way back to before the American Civil War!
